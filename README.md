50.002 Computation Structures @ SUTD

__1D project__
* Construction of a 1-bit full adder with an FPGA tester `(/1-bit-full-adder-FPGA/)`
* Implementation of an 8-bit ALU design on an FPGA `(/8-bit-ALU/)`
* Design and prototype of an electronic game using the 8-bit ALU

__2D project__
* Optimization of a 32-bit adder `(/32-bit-adder-2D/)`
>3 variants with different trade-offs were tested: the __Kogge-Stone__ (large area, high speed, minimal fanout), __Sklansky__ (divide and conquer, high fanout), and __Brent-Kung__ (lowest area, high logic depth, minimal fanout) architectures.
